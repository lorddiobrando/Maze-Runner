This project models the famous path finding (maze) problem as a grid. Given an initial position, an agent tries to reach another position (goal). The techniques used differ based on multiple aspects
, such as complexity and type. The techniques can be divided into four categories as follows: Uninformed search, informed search, local search, Genetic algorithms, and reinforcement learning. The implementations of those 
algorithms uses mainly both pyamaze and numpy modules. 

Uninformed search algorithms:
  - BFS
  - DFS
  - Djikstra
  - IDS

Informed search algorithms:
  - A*
  - Greedy best-first search

Local search algorithms:
  - Hill climbing
  - Simulated annealing

Genetic algorithms.

Reinforcement Learning:
  - Q-learning
