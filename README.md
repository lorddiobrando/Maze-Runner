This project models the famous path finding (maze) problem as a grid. Given an initial position, an agent tries to reach another position (goal). The techniques used differ based on multiple aspects ,
such as complexity and type. The techniques can be divided into four categories as follows: Uninformed search, informed search, local search, Genetic algorithms, and reinforcement learning. 
The implementations of those algorithms uses mainly both pyamaze and numpy modules.

Uninformed search algorithms:

  - BFS
  - DFS
  - Djikstra
  - IDS
Informed search algorithms:

  - A*
  - Greedy best-first search
  
Local search algorithms:

  - Hill climbing
  - Simulated annealing
  
Genetic algorithms.

Reinforcement Learning:

  - Q-learning
